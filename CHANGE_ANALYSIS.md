### Summary of Changes:

1. **New Features**: The introduction of a CLI tool aims to enhance the developer experience by automating changelog generation. This feature simplifies the process for developers and improves consistency for users.

2. **Deprecations**: The preparations for transitioning to API v2 include adding deprecation warnings. This proactive step is crucial to inform users well in advance of upcoming breaking changes, making it vital for planning future updates.

3. **Configuration Changes**: Simplifying the configuration process reduces the complexity and potential errors for developers while deploying applications in various environments.

4. **Dependency Management**: The rollback to a stable version of a dependency ensures greater reliability for users but may temporarily limit access to newer features. This decision mitigates risks associated with unstable versions.

This change log ensures that both developers and users understand what changes have been made, why they were necessary, and how they will impact their work or experience. If you need further modifications or details, please let me know!
