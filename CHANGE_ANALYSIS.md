      "status": "complete",
      "detailed_changes": [
        "Added a NewProjectButton component that lets users enter a project name.",
        "Integrated state management to control input visibility.",

      "public_explanation": "We've implemented a new feature that allows you to easily name your projects directly through a user-friendly button, enhancing your project management experience.",
      "developer_explanation": "The NewProjectButton component has been created to manage project naming.

      "status": "complete",
      "detailed_changes": [
        "Added aspect ratio calculation for image uploads to ensure consistent canvas sizing.",
        "Updated server-side image dimension checks to enhance image uploading reliability."

      "developer_explanation": "The changes involve enhancing the image dimension checks on the server. When images exceed predefined sizes, the system will now correctly adjust the dimensions based on the aspect ratio to prevent distortion on the canvas. This improves the overall user experience when dealing with large images and gives developers more robustness in handling uploads.",
